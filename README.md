opencv-startup
==============

I am gonna learn OpenCV for my final year thesis.And all implementation will be here.


What is OpenCV?
================
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions for real time computer vision. Basically this library provides
functions/method to process images (ex-Face Recognition)
 
Find detailes [here](http://opencv.org/)



Environment
==============
1. OS       - MAC 10.8
2. IDE      - QT/XCODE
3. Language - C++



Target
==============
 Building up a system to recognize a face taken by camera with a database.
 
 
Installation
==============
This library can be integrated with almost all IDEs, like I have used on Eclipse,Netbeans,Codeblocks and QT. Installation process is same for all. 
I am describing here how to integrate opencv with QT.
Step 1 : Download opencv library from [http://opencv.org/downloads.html](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
Step 2 : Extract and confirm that there are lib,bin and include folder.
Step 3 : copy all files of lib/ to your system's 'lib/' folder
Step 3 : copy all files of bin to your system's 'bin/' folder
Step 4 : copy all two folder 'opencv' and 'opencv2' to system's 'include/' folder
Step 4 : According to your IDE, see the properties.If you find any option to add additional library or linker then add the path.

Thats it.You are ready to go. Still if you can't run the code send an email to usuttra@yahoo.com
